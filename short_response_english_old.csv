And if it is bad, whether it will entertain electronic games? I see my dogs, accustomed to a particular mode of the day, strive even in our presence in the morning as usual to sleep.

If the dog takes all ""for real"" include hunting behavior, shaking, overexcited, then it is better to come up with a different game with the tablet. For example, some intellectual with the issuance of delicacies from the host (or from another device connected automatically).
 The idea to leave the plates on the absence of the owners, I like it. Then the dog will have a chance not to miss much of the house. But in this case you will need to install them to turn off automatically after a certain time of the game. Again, the dog is not too overexcited and it does not matter to her detriment. How to allocate the time of a possible electronic device activity, the owner can decide for himself, guided by their dog's behavior during the game. Time for rest, through which the dog can go back and turn it on, should also be set individually.

I think such games should be calm with the predictable result of equipment intended only for dogs intelligence, rather than the rate of the reaction. Perhaps you can play on the similarity of those that provide for small children 2 cards- guess the color, repeat the sound ..

In the future, it is possible to interact with the ""dog technique"" in smart homes. And yet the skills to work with touch-screen / touch pad can simply add variety to the life of the dog and the owner.
 Only important when the dog interacting with technology to monitor her emotional reaction. For example, our dog when accessing it via skype human friends, begins to run around the house to check the inputs, trying to find these people. Then, disappointed, sitting with round eyes, prominent proteins, panting, and then goes to his place and go to bed. But if someone from the owners is on the phone dog familiar and important ""wait at home"" ""I'll soon be"", ""it is necessary to wait a bit"" doggy door checks, but does not show signs of stress.
